# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in our GitLab DevSecOps pipeline and infrastructure.

## Pipeline Security Measures

### 1. Container Scanning
- Using Trivy for container vulnerability scanning
- Scanning base images and application dependencies
- Automated scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Policy enforcement for critical vulnerabilities

### 2. SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- GitLab built-in SAST analyzers
- Custom rulesets for application-specific threats
- Automated code review for security issues
- Coverage reports in merge requests

### 3. Dependency Scanning
- Regular scanning of dependencies
- Automated updates for security patches
- Version pinning for stability
- Software composition analysis

### 4. Secret Detection
- GitLab secret detection
- Custom patterns for organization-specific secrets
- Pre-commit hooks for local development
- Automated blocking of sensitive data

## Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security
- Private subnets for ECS tasks
- Security groups with minimal access
- IAM roles with least privilege
- KMS encryption for sensitive data
- VPC endpoints for AWS services

### Container Security
- Minimal base images
- Non-root container user
- Read-only root filesystem
- Resource limitations
- Security headers in nginx configuration

### Network Security
- Private subnets for application tier
- WAF integration
- HTTPS enforcement
- Network isolation
- Load balancer security groups

## Security Best Practices

### GitOps Security
1. Encrypted state files
2. State file locking
3. Version control for all changes
4. Audit logging enabled
5. Required merge request approvals

### Access Control
1. Role-based access control (RBAC)
2. MFA enforcement
3. Regular access reviews
4. Audit logging
5. Session management

### Monitoring & Alerts
1. CloudWatch logs
2. CloudTrail audit logs
3. Security Hub integration
4. GuardDuty enabled
5. Automated security alerts

## Compliance & Auditing
- Regular security assessments
- Compliance reporting
- Audit trails
- Incident response plan
- Security documentation

## Local Development Security
1. Pre-commit hooks setup
2. Local security scanning
3. Secrets management
4. Development environment isolation
