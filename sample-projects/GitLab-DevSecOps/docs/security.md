# Basic Security Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the basic security measures implemented in our simple CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure.

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- AWS IAM roles with necessary permissions
- GitLab registry authentication
- ECS task execution roles

### 2. Network Security
- Application Load Balancer with HTTPS support
- Security groups with required ports only
- VPC with proper routing

### 3. Dependency Scanning
- Regular scanning of dependencies
- Automated updates for security patches
- Version pinning for stability
- Software composition analysis

### 4. Secret Detection
- GitLab secret detection
- Custom patterns for organization-specific secrets
- Pre-commit hooks for local development
- Automated blocking of sensitive data

## Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security
- Private subnets for ECS tasks
- Security groups with minimal access
- IAM roles with least privilege
- KMS encryption for sensitive data
- VPC endpoints for AWS services

### Container Security
- Minimal base images
- Non-root container user
- Read-only root filesystem
- Resource limitations
- Security headers in nginx configuration

### Network Security
- Private subnets for application tier
- WAF integration
- HTTPS enforcement
- Network isolation
- Load balancer security groups

## Security Best Practices

### GitOps Security
1. Encrypted state files
2. State file locking
3. Version control for all changes
4. Audit logging enabled
5. Required merge request approvals

### Access Control
1. Role-based access control (RBAC)
2. MFA enforcement
3. Regular access reviews
4. Audit logging
5. Session management

### Monitoring & Alerts
1. CloudWatch logs
2. CloudTrail audit logs
3. Security Hub integration
4. GuardDuty enabled
5. Automated security alerts

## Compliance & Auditing
- Regular security assessments
- Compliance reporting
- Audit trails
- Incident response plan
- Security documentation

## Local Development Security
1. Pre-commit hooks setup
2. Local security scanning
3. Secrets management
4. Development environment isolation
